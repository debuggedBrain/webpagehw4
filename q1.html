I love sports. I was a swimmer and soccer player in high school. I play
foorball with my friends at different turf fields in NJ for fun. 
I love playing Fantasy Football. I also love computers and playing around with their insides.
I also enjoy learning about business andf how it relates to the computing world.

I go to NJIT and I am Information Technology Major. I will be a senior next year and hope to graduate. 
My little brother also wants to go to NJIT when he is done with high school. I only have one sibling.
I love the winter and fall because I like cold weather in general. I currently work at Amazon as a sortation associate.
I get in contact with most packages getting shipped out in NJ before they get to the customers.
